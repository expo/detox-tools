# What is this
The `expo-detox-cli` runs self repair scripts for the dynamic library we insert in at runtime in order to have an expo app play well with the detox testing harness.

# Installation
You can install the cli by running `npm install -g expo-detox-cli`.

# Usage
Reset and build the framework by running `expotox clean-framework-cache && expotox build-framework-cache`
